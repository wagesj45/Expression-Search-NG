<b>Version 5.3</b>

In order to move forward with the current release cycle (monthly releases) I decided to raise minimum version to Thunderbird 128, I am doing regular testing with the current beta versions but they may only be a single version number ahead! To help test new versions and be ahead of the curve, you can subscribe to issue #262.

<b>Improvements</b>
<ul>
  <li> Made compatible with Thunderbird 140.*.  </li>
  <li> Improvement in asynchronous Save Attachments, leading to slow down of Thunderbird when filtering POP3 mail (no copy listener) <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/FiltaQuilla/issues/349">[issue 349]</a>. We are now allowed to use nsIThreadManager.processNextEvent() in order to give cycles back to the system while the attachments are processed. Please restart Thunderbird to force changes to come into effect. </li>
  <li> Play sound improvements: Fixed open sound file button, extracting the supplied sounds to the default folder profile/extensions/filtaquilla and added a play sound button to filter editor.<a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/FiltaQuilla/issues/350">[issue 350]</a> </li>
</ul>

<strong>Support My Work</strong>

As I am often asked about added features for filter conditions and actions for my Add-on <a href="https://addons.thunderbird.net/addon/quickfilters/">quickFilters</a> - FiltaQuilla is a better location for extending Filter behavior - specifically adding new types of Actions and Conditions.
